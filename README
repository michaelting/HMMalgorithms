*** NOTE: This program takes ~4-5 minutes to finish running! ***

For EM, this program takes about 15 seconds per EM iteration.
EM data is output in stdout, so we can see values change at 
each iteration of the algorithm.

#=============#
# Quick Start #
#=============#

Running the command: 

$ python hmm.py sequences_4mu.fasta 4mu initial_parameters_4mu.txt

would produce 4 output files in the current directory:

- estimated_parameters_4mu.txt
- likelihoods_4mu.txt
- decodings_initial_4mu.txt
- decodings_estimated_4mu.txt

where the argument "4mu" is incorporated into the names of each of
the output files.

# STDOUT #

Various details are displayd on the standard output. Statements printed
to stdout will indicate what task the program is currently performing.
For the EM algorithm, estimates from each of the 15 iterations will be
displayed. Further calculations are not as detailed on stdout, but stdout
will still indicate the calculations that are being performed.

You can observe the command line options by using:

$ python hmm.py --help

The script requires 3 arguments:

$ python hmm.py infile muname initparams

- infile: A FASTA file of two sequences for input
- muname: A string corresponding to the mu name, e.g. "mu","2mu","5mu"
- initparams: The input initial parameters txt file

An example run would be:

$ python hmm.py sequences_4mu.fasta 4mu initial_parameters_4mu.txt

Notice that the "muname" argument is a string corresponding to the
value of mu used in the input files. This is required for naming
output files that result from running the program.

** Take care to enter the muname argument correctly! Files will be
output with * corresponding to the "muname" argument as such:

- estimated_parameters_*.txt
- likelihoods_*.txt
- decodings_initial_*.txt
- decodings_estimated_*.txt

For example, entering the command:

$ python hmm.py sequences_4mu.fasta 2mu initial_parameters_4mu.txt

would calculate results for the 4mu data, but label all output files as:

- estimated_parameters_2mu.txt
- likelihoods_2mu.txt
- decodings_initial_2mu.txt
- decodings_estimated_2mu.txt

We do NOT want this, since we could end up mixing up the data.
